### Igor Corovic - S3799257
My name is Igor Corovic and my student number is S3799257.  I speak Serbian but after the war everyone has a variation of Serbian as their language so technically, in addition to Serbian I speak Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin. My hobby is photography which has drained my wallet more than the Apple store. My interests in IT revolve around ensuring the end user has the best experience and planning ahead to ensure the company is futureproof. Since 2012 I have worked in QLD Govt IT where I got the opportunity to work in all different fields but currently working on assisting business units to implements SaaS packages.

### Jayden Kube - S3803380
Hi my name is Jayden Kube and my IT interest began at a young age when my Pop introduced me to his PC, at the time it was the most fascinating thing to me and still is to this day. The fact I was able to do everything I wanted on a computer just blew my mind. I could listen to music, create visuals, do schoolwork, browse the internet and do my favourite thing at the time and play Adventure Quest. From this when I learnt how to use most of the built-in programs, and I became fascinated with Windows Movie Maker and I used to make basic slideshow type videos with photos my family took and burn it to a DVD and sell it to them for $5 each. I then went on to using Adobe After Effects and editing videos for YouTube and gained experience in using it which I can still do to this day.

### Alexander Loos - S3807721
I originally come from the Netherlands, was raised in England until around 13 years old then moved here to be closer to family, i was raised around technology and what sparked my curiosity in Tech and gaming was a series known as Call of Duty, i would play it every chance i got as a small child, this was the starting point to me owning every game i could find and get. Then when Medal of Hounor and Battlefield came into the light i played all of them, i now own every MOH and BAttlefield title ever made, yes, even Battlefield free to play.

Although my knowledge of games is large, my knowledge of how they work and how other systems work is something i have yet to discover, this is the main reason iâ€™m doing this course, so that i may build knowledge of how different systems opperate and then be able to modify/ improve them. I plan on finding a job within the Cyber Security side of things as i believe as the world becomes more digital it also becomes more vulnerable.

### Alexander Edmondson - S3403540
My name is Alexander Edmondson I was originally born in Wollongong, but now reside in Bayside, Melbourne. This subject is one of the last in my bachelor of business (financial planning). I am interested in IT however most of my 
interest (when it comes to employment) is in equities trading. That is where I am currently 
employed. However, I do enjoy playing video games on my PC, listening to music and 
generally surfing the web. In the FX industry there are many platforms that are IT based, this 
is where this subject and my interest in IT will come through and help me in future 
employment

### Team Profile
Reading the test outcomes of each group member enables the group to gain a thorough 
understanding of individual strengths and weaknesses. This information is useful in enabling the 
group to working effectively while minimising stresses placed on individuals. As a group we are able 
to be better organised and take part in successful collaborative task completion which will result in a 
confidence boost for all involved.

### Ideal Jobs
Members of the group have varied ideal jobs. This is impacted by a variety of reasons such as current 
age, experience and education level. The group members have different job targets however there 
are common areas of all ideal jobs. Common elements which are found, is that all jobs are in the 
Information Technology field and for all these jobs, the group members lack qualifications or 
experience. As this is for an ideal job the lacking of qualifications and experiences is to be expected 
as generally most people throughout life tend to strive for a higher goal and job satisfaction.
