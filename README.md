### Interview Questions
## Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
 manage the call volumes and provide guidance to new staff. I get involved if we have a VIP 
request where I will monitor the job and intervene if necessary. There are other times such as 
a major outage or similar I will be directing the initial response.
##  Please tell us about the industry you work in?
I work in the QLD Govt IT. My IT department is unique in the fact it supports four 
departments and a few statutory authorities totalling over 9,000 staff. There is a lot more 
focus on IT security than what you would typically see in private enterprise. Govt typically 
waits for program bugs to be ironed out before updating its own fleet which makes us a tad 
behind the latest and greatest tech. We still have a large portion of our users on Win 7.
