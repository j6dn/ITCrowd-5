### Igor Corovic - S3799257
My name is Igor Corovic and my student number is S3799257.  I speak Serbian but after the war everyone has a variation of Serbian as their language so technically, in addition to Serbian I speak Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin. My hobby is photography which has drained my wallet more than the Apple store. My interests in IT revolve around ensuring the end user has the best experience and planning ahead to ensure the company is futureproof. Since 2012 I have worked in QLD Govt IT where I got the opportunity to work in all different fields but currently working on assisting business units to implements SaaS packages.

### Jayden Kube - S3803380
Hi my name is Jayden Kube and my IT interest began at a young age when my Pop introduced me to his PC, at the time it was the most fascinating thing to me and still is to this day. The fact I was able to do everything I wanted on a computer just blew my mind. I could listen to music, create visuals, do schoolwork, browse the internet and do my favourite thing at the time and play Adventure Quest. From this when I learnt how to use most of the built-in programs, and I became fascinated with Windows Movie Maker and I used to make basic slideshow type videos with photos my family took and burn it to a DVD and sell it to them for $5 each. I then went on to using Adobe After Effects and editing videos for YouTube and gained experience in using it which I can still do to this day.
