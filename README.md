# Assignment 2

### Interview Questions
- **Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?**
 manage the call volumes and provide guidance to new staff. I get involved if we have a VIP 
request where I will monitor the job and intervene if necessary. There are other times such as 
a major outage or similar I will be directing the initial response.
- **Please tell us about the industry you work in?**
I work in the QLD Govt IT. My IT department is unique in the fact it supports four 
departments and a few statutory authorities totalling over 9,000 staff. There is a lot more 
focus on IT security than what you would typically see in private enterprise. Govt typically 
waits for program bugs to be ironed out before updating its own fleet which makes us a tad 
behind the latest and greatest tech. We still have a large portion of our users on Win 7.
- **What other kinds of work do you have to do?**
Depending what is happening sometimes we have weekend work if a department is having a 
restructure. This involves everyone helping to re-connect all the moved machines and being 
on hand the next day should something not work.
- **Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.**
It is a mix of different people from varying sections depending on what the issue is. On a 
regular basis it would be the techs from Dell/HP who come out to fix broken laptops or the 
purchasing team if you need to buy software/hardware. Clients are obviously a big part of 
my job and with remote access I can fix their problems in Mt Isa from my office.
- **Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.**
Depending where the job takes me on the day I could end up talking to different teams to 
resolve the issue. Generally I try to help the client but If I cannot I send the job to a specialist 
area such as Security or Workplace Technology. It is beneficial to have expert working around 
you because you learn new methods for resolving certain problems. We do use contactors for 
infrequent things such as mobile app development.
- **What about your interactions with clients or investors?**
Being Govt we don’t have investors but do have stakeholders which are the departments we 
service. We need to be transparent and accountable in our dealings and resolve issues fairly 
quickly without impacting the business. Sometimes it is challenging trying to explain 
complicated processes to non I.T. personnel in a way they can understand. Being around 
other IT personnel all day I tend to forget when I’m with a client but the blank stare on their 
face as I’m explaining the problem makes me remember to use plain English.
- **What aspects of your time do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these**
In my role as Team Leader, most of my time is organising the staff’s daily workload as well as 
various HR duties ie: Rostering, approving my staff’s timesheets and liaising between the 
staff and the various support groups.
- **What aspects of your work do you find most challenging?**
I wouldn’t say anything is more challenging that another but there are certainly boring and 
fun jobs. I look at every new problem as an opportunity to learn the solution
- **Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?**
It would have to be the coordination of so many IT areas and people to get this monster off 
the ground and working. I link it to a car – many bolts and belts that all work together to 
hold the car and move it. IT is very similar!
- **What was your worst experience with a client or what did they break beyond logical understanding?**
hmmmm, Once had client who called the service desk to advise his CD player exploded, 
when I asked what he meant by exploded he said exactly that, he put a CD in the tray, went 
to play and it went bang. I sent one of my techs to have a look and he came back laughing, 
somehow, none of us know how, the CD did in fact shatter in the drive, pieces of the PC case 
were fractured and when we pulled it apart, there were pieces of CD scattered throughout 
the case. To this day we have never seen or heard of another example of this happening.

### IT Work
IT professionals do a variety of work sometimes not entirely in the “IT field” as popular opinion 
would suggest. The IT professional interviewed for this assignment is a Team Leader within a 
Queensland Government department, who is responsible for overseeing functions of the Service 
Desk which is the first point of contact for clients.
The role of a Service Desk Team Leader performs a wide range of functions including managing call 
volumes, providing guidance and training to staff, rostering and liaising between different groups to 
get the job done. It is a very dynamic role requiring skills in multiple fields not necessarily just in IT.
Interaction with clients is the most common type of interaction when working on the Service Desk. 
The Team Leader role has a wider level of interacting as this role is responsible for coordination of 
various tasks throughout the IT department as a whole. At times there are Very Important Person 
(VIP) requests which typically need progressing more urgently than regular jobs. To achieve this the 
Team Leader will oversee the resolution to the job and escalate the job if it is not progressing at a 
reasonable speed.
At times there are jobs with complex requirements such as a new system rollout which need greater 
scrutiny from specialist areas before it is released to be used by the client. This will involve liaising 
with Security, Networks or Workplace Technology who is responsible for packaging the software for 
easy install by the client.
Occasionally hardware will break which requires a service call placed to the vendor who will repair 
the item. The Team Leader will coordinate with external stakeholders such as Dell and HP to ensure 
availability of service personnel and adequate spare parts are kept in stock for the models used by 
the clients.
The majority of the time, the Team Leader spends organising staff availability and various HR duties 
and liaising between staff and various support groups. While this is an IT role by definition, a large 
percentage of time is spent doing traditional managerial duties.
White the Team Leader did mention anything specific about being most challenging, the role 
certainly appears to need a person capable of remaining calm in difficult situations and being able to 
make quick decisions which will need to stand up to scrutiny if something was to go wrong later. The 
nature of this role makes it evident the right person requires ample workplace experience in IT and 
management to be a successful Team Leader.

### Team Profile
Reading the test outcomes of each group member enables the group to gain a thorough 
understanding of individual strengths and weaknesses. This information is useful in enabling the 
group to working effectively while minimising stresses placed on individuals. As a group we are able 
to be better organised and take part in successful collaborative task completion which will result in a 
confidence boost for all involved.

### Ideal Jobs
Members of the group have varied ideal jobs. This is impacted by a variety of reasons such as current 
age, experience and education level. The group members have different job targets however there 
are common areas of all ideal jobs. Common elements which are found, is that all jobs are in the 
Information Technology field and for all these jobs, the group members lack qualifications or 
experience. As this is for an ideal job the lacking of qualifications and experiences is to be expected 
as generally most people throughout life tend to strive for a higher goal and job satisfaction.
