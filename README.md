### Interview Questions
- **Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?**
 manage the call volumes and provide guidance to new staff. I get involved if we have a VIP 
request where I will monitor the job and intervene if necessary. There are other times such as 
a major outage or similar I will be directing the initial response.
- **Please tell us about the industry you work in?**
I work in the QLD Govt IT. My IT department is unique in the fact it supports four 
departments and a few statutory authorities totalling over 9,000 staff. There is a lot more 
focus on IT security than what you would typically see in private enterprise. Govt typically 
waits for program bugs to be ironed out before updating its own fleet which makes us a tad 
behind the latest and greatest tech. We still have a large portion of our users on Win 7.
- **What other kinds of work do you have to do?**
Depending what is happening sometimes we have weekend work if a department is having a 
restructure. This involves everyone helping to re-connect all the moved machines and being 
on hand the next day should something not work.
- **Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.**
It is a mix of different people from varying sections depending on what the issue is. On a 
regular basis it would be the techs from Dell/HP who come out to fix broken laptops or the 
purchasing team if you need to buy software/hardware. Clients are obviously a big part of 
my job and with remote access I can fix their problems in Mt Isa from my office.
- **Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.**
Depending where the job takes me on the day I could end up talking to different teams to 
resolve the issue. Generally I try to help the client but If I cannot I send the job to a specialist 
area such as Security or Workplace Technology. It is beneficial to have expert working around 
you because you learn new methods for resolving certain problems. We do use contactors for 
infrequent things such as mobile app development.
- **What about your interactions with clients or investors?**
Being Govt we don’t have investors but do have stakeholders which are the departments we 
service. We need to be transparent and accountable in our dealings and resolve issues fairly 
quickly without impacting the business. Sometimes it is challenging trying to explain 
complicated processes to non I.T. personnel in a way they can understand. Being around 
other IT personnel all day I tend to forget when I’m with a client but the blank stare on their 
face as I’m explaining the problem makes me remember to use plain English.
- **What aspects of your time do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these**
In my role as Team Leader, most of my time is organising the staff’s daily workload as well as 
various HR duties ie: Rostering, approving my staff’s timesheets and liaising between the 
staff and the various support groups.
- **What aspects of your work do you find most challenging?**
I wouldn’t say anything is more challenging that another but there are certainly boring and 
fun jobs. I look at every new problem as an opportunity to learn the solution
- **Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?**
It would have to be the coordination of so many IT areas and people to get this monster off 
the ground and working. I link it to a car – many bolts and belts that all work together to 
hold the car and move it. IT is very similar!
- **What was your worst experience with a client or what did they break beyond logical understanding?**
hmmmm, Once had client who called the service desk to advise his CD player exploded, 
when I asked what he meant by exploded he said exactly that, he put a CD in the tray, went 
to play and it went bang. I sent one of my techs to have a look and he came back laughing, 
somehow, none of us know how, the CD did in fact shatter in the drive, pieces of the PC case 
were fractured and when we pulled it apart, there were pieces of CD scattered throughout 
the case. To this day we have never seen or heard of another example of this happening.
