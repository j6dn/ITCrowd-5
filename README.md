# Assignment 3

### Igor Corovic - S3799257
My name is Igor Corovic and my student number is S3799257.  I speak Serbian but after the war everyone has a variation of Serbian as their language so technically, in addition to Serbian I speak Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin. My hobby is photography which has drained my wallet more than the Apple store. My interests in IT revolve around ensuring the end user has the best experience and planning ahead to ensure the company is futureproof. Since 2012 I have worked in QLD Govt IT where I got the opportunity to work in all different fields but currently working on assisting business units to implements SaaS packages.

### Jayden Kube - S3803380
Hi my name is Jayden Kube and my IT interest began at a young age when my Pop introduced me to his PC, at the time it was the most fascinating thing to me and still is to this day. The fact I was able to do everything I wanted on a computer just blew my mind. I could listen to music, create visuals, do schoolwork, browse the internet and do my favourite thing at the time and play Adventure Quest. From this when I learnt how to use most of the built-in programs, and I became fascinated with Windows Movie Maker and I used to make basic slideshow type videos with photos my family took and burn it to a DVD and sell it to them for $5 each. I then went on to using Adobe After Effects and editing videos for YouTube and gained experience in using it which I can still do to this day.

### Alexander Edmondson - S3403540
My name is Alexander Edmondson I was originally born in Wollongong, but now reside in Bayside, Melbourne. This subject is one of the last in my bachelor of business (financial planning). I am interested in IT however most of my 
interest (when it comes to employment) is in equities trading. That is where I am currently 
employed. However, I do enjoy playing video games on my PC, listening to music and 
generally surfing the web. In the FX industry there are many platforms that are IT based, this 
is where this subject and my interest in IT will come through and help me in future 
employment

### Group Processes
In Assignment 2, we initially had a problem with two of the team members did not respond at all. We gave them a week to join the Discord chat after which we assigned tasks and started working on the project without them. At this time, we had four team members which was enough to carry out the assignment. The system we have in place works well for us so there are no changes to be introduced for Assignment 3.

### Career Plans
Members of the group have inspiration which differ from one another. The ideal jobs of the team member are at different areas of the IT industry but the common are from everyone is their desire to work in the IT industry. Currently, the group members lack qualifications or experience for their ideal job and have taken action to remedy this by undertaking studying.
